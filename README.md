# Wrote a simple algorithm for Question 1


Write a simple C# function that given an array of N integers, return the smallest positive integer
(greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
For example,
Given A= [1,5,7,4,1,2] the function should return 3.
Given A = [1,2,3] the function should return 4
Given A = [-1, -3] the function should return 1
write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions
Note That:
• N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]
• each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000..1,000,000]
